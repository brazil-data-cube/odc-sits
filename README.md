[Open Data Cube](https://www.opendatacube.org/) is a system designed to manage Spatio-temporal Earth Observation Data Cubes. 

The `odc-sits` package is an R Client for the Open Data Cube ecosystem. The Data Cube representation performed by odc-sits is based on the [SITS package](https://github.com/e-sensing/sits). This pairing gives the possibility of using ODC data products in satellite image time series classification.
